# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES

:tada: Welcome, thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! :balloon: To get started, please read the [Code of Conduct](Link to CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## HOW DO I CONTRIBUTE TO A PROJECT?

- If this is your first contribution, see [NEWCOMERS.md](NEWCOMERS.md). You might also want to take up issues with Lablel `good first issue`.

- Discuss the changes you wish to make by creating an `issue`, comment on an already created issue, or contact us via our [general channel](link [discord, slack, any other prefered mediem]).
- Once you have been assigned the issue by the maintainer, you can go ahead to fork the repo, clone and make changes to fix the issue. For steps on how to do this, [this here](NEWCOMERS.md) is a helpful guide.

## MAKING YOUR PULL REQUEST

When you are done with your changes, and you have checked the new changes you made, you can create a pull request referencing the number of the issue you fixed in the description as seen here:
```
This PR fixes issue # "issue number"
```

Once, you have completed this, your pull request would be reviewed by a maintainer, if it satisfies the requirements of the corresponding issue to which it was made, it would be merged.

Kudos to you :balloon:
